# Encryption & Decryption paper

## paper conclusion
Cryptography has played a vital role in keeping our data safe from hacking and other threats. Cryptographic algorithms have been developed over the years starting with Caesar Cipher (invented around 100 BC) [7], which was simply by shifting each letter 3 steps back like that:

up till 2005 when ECC (Elliptic-Curve-cryptography) has been invented, and you may ask yourself why all of that? The answer is, the more cryptanalysis evolves, the more powerful algorithm we’ll need for the purpose of securing all kinds of data – personal, financial, medical, commercial, etc.., so each following algorithm is trying to eliminate or decrease the vulnerabilities of its previous one to build one that’s much harder to break. we’ve presented a review of some public algorithms - DES, AES, RSA, and RC4 for each we’ve explained how encryption and decryption process work in detail, and how it contributes to better security than the previous one.
